My name is Pete Roden and this in my blog. I am an Azure Ninja at Microsoft on the Global Black Belt team specializing in application development. I am currently focused on serverless, IoT, containers and distributed cloud architectures. But I pretty much love anything to do with technology.

On this blog I will share the projects. architectures,etc. that I am working on and hope they help you with your own projects.

Thanks for visiting!
